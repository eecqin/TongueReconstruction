Tools to reconstruct the entire tongue shapes for MOCHA and X-ray Microbeam databases from a few landmarks on the tongue.
Tongue reconstruction is achieved by adapting a pre-trained prediction model of tongue shapes. 
More technical details can be found at Qin, C. and Carreira-Perpinan "Reconstructing the full tongue contour from EMA/X-Ray microbeam". IEEE Int. Conf. on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2010).
